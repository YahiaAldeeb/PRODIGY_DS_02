#Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This task involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a chosen dataset, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The main objectives are to clean the data, explore the relationships between variables, and identify patterns and trends that can provide insights into the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this task is the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, such as their age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Passenger fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Data Cleaning

In this step, we address missing values, handle outliers, and ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and fill or drop missing data. For instance, filling missing 'Age' values with the median age, or dropping rows with missing 'Cabin' values.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detect and handle outliers in numeric variables, such as 'Fare' or 'Age'.
- **Data Formatting**: Ensure all categorical data is properly encoded, and numeric data is appropriately scaled if necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase involves visualizing and analyzing the relationships between variables to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.

- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyze individual variables, such as the distribution of age, fare, and the survival rate.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between two variables, such as survival rate by gender, age, or class.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Investigate relationships involving more than two variables, such as how gender and class together influence survival.
- **Visualization**: Use plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts, heatmaps) to visually represent the data and relationships between variables.

## Results

The EDA reveals key insights into the Titanic dataset:

- **Survival Rate**: The overall survival rate and survival rates based on gender, class, and age.
- **Influencing Factors**: Identification of key factors that influenced survival, such as gender (females had a higher survival rate) and class (1st class passengers had a higher survival rate).
- **Data Patterns**: Patterns and trends that emerged from the analysis, such as the correlation between fare and survival.

## Conclusion

The data cleaning and EDA processes provided valuable insights into the Titanic dataset. By cleaning the data and analyzing it through various methods, we were able to identify significant patterns and trends, which could be useful for predictive modeling or further research.

## Dependencies and Setup

To run the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
